In 1125 the Mongols were under the banner, Khamag Mongol. Soon the Khamag Mongol broke apart into different clans due to the war with the Tatars, another large tribe to the west. At that time Yesugei was chief of the Borjigin clan. He was trying to reunite the Mongols. Temujin at the age of 9 married Borte. During the wedding, Yesugei was poisoned by the Tatars. After the death of Yesugei, Temujin was exiled along with his family. Temujin was homeless for the next six years. Once he was captured by the Tatars. But he managed to escape. With the help of Toghrul Khan, chief of the Karaite tribe and his brother Jamukha Temujin formed his own tribe. Temujin fought alongside Jamukha but they had a disagreement. Temujin gave power to people who weren't part of the tribe but Jamukha didn't like that. So he defeated Temujin with an army of 30000. Ten years later Temujin led the army of the Karaite tribe against the Tatars. After winning, he started to gain more power. He used the decimal system for his army. The smallest unit, an Arban, was made up of ten archers who each had 5 - 6 horses. After a day of riding the soldiers would ride a different horse thus ensuring that one of the horses wasn't overworked. They were also fitted out with a recurve bow which they made themselves. These bows could fire arrows up to 320 meters. Mongols learnt how to use the bow and ride when they were still children. When one of the soldiers in an Arban ran away the other nine were executed. 10 Arbans made up a zuun which had 100 soldiers. 10 Zuuns would make up a Mingghan which had 1000 soldiers. 10 mingghans made up a tumen which had 10,000 soldiers. The commanders of the arbans, zuuns and mingghans were elected by the men. The commanders of the tumen were chosen by Temujin. Soon many tribes chose Jamukha as the new Great Khan. After a five year war, Temujin won at the Battle of the Thirteen Sides. Temujin created a council who renamed him Genghis Khan which meant strong leader. In the coming years, Genghis Khan would recruit soldiers from countries he conquered. In 1209 Genghis Khan took over Western Xia. He managed to win easily in the open battles but struggled to take the fortified cities as he did not have any siege equipment. The Mongols then set sights on the Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty outnumbered the Mongols. But the Jin army was spread across China. Soon the Mongol army broke through the Great Wall of China. The Mongol army then split into two parts. 30,000 mounted archers. led by Genghis Khan's son Ogedei attacked the city of Datong, which was behind the Great Wall of China. While 60,000 horse-archers led by Genghis Khan went for the Juyong Pass leading to Beijing. Their plans were thwarted when the Jin army stopped them at Yehuling. Genghis Khan sent his best generals Jebe and Subutai to attack the western front from behind. Jebe had started as Genghis Khan's enemy. When he shot an arrow and wounded Genghis Khan at the Battle of Thirteen Sides. After winning Genghis Khan accepted Jebe's skill and let him become his general. After winning they returned to Genghis Khan. After which Genghis Khan pushed forward on the Jin army. Part of the army went around the pass and attacked from behind. Jebe then retreated the rear army and then turned back and ambushed the pursuing Jin army. Genghis Khan started pillaging and left for the winter. When he returned he attacked fortresses and waited for the Jin army to stop them and when they did they were ambushed. Soon Genghis Khan's army had an epidemic and they agreed to peace and left. When Genghis Khan learned that the Jin had moved their court to the south. Genghis Khan returned and finished Beijing off. The Mongol Empire had now taken over the Jin Dynasty. The chief of one of the tribes the Mongols had defeated, Kuchlug1 had fled to Western Liao. Eventually, he rebelled against the leader of western Liao and took control of the empire. Genghis Khan's general Jebe then attacked western Liao and took over the empire in the battle of Balasagun. Genghis Khan sent merchants with a cart full of gifts in hopes of negotiating a peace treaty with the Khwarezm. The garrisons captured the merchants and confiscated the gifts claiming that they were spies. Genghis Khan then sent ambassadors trying to get the merchants back but they were executed. Genghis Khan, who believed that it was important to accommodate guests, took this very seriously and waged war on the empire. Jochi and Jebe attacked Ferghana through the Tian Shan. The enemy then attacked them as they thought this was most of the Mongol army. At the same time Chagatai and Ogedei, his other sons, attacked Otrar and they killed its entire population and burnt it to the ground This drew the Samarkand garrison to them. Meanwhile, Genghis Khan led an army from above to attack Bukhara. When its garrison was killed Genghis Khan set sights on Samarkand. They feigned retreat and then ambushed the garrisons. The sultan of the Khwarezmian Empire, Shah Mohammad tried to retake the capital. But they were pushed back. Most of the city surrendered and its population was slaughtered. Genghis Khan and Jochi attacked Urgench from both sides. Once they took it over Jochi tried to get the inhabitants to give him their loot. While his brothers said that the city should be raided. Genghis Khan agreed with Jochi's brothers and replaced Jochi with his other son Ogedei. With the small army of the Mongols, they killed most of the population as they couldn't control it. Shah escaped to the west and Subutai and Jebe followed. Subutai failed to catch the sultan and he managed to escape into the Caspian sea where he would eventually die. Subutai kept raiding the villages and ensured that the Shah couldn't recruit an army. Subutai then led his army up into Georgia where he pillaged the lands. George VI, King of Georgia assembled an army and engaged the Mongol armies in the battle of Sagami. Subutai used the trademark Mongol tactic of a feigned retreat after which he removed the King's army. Subutai then left and returned after raiding more Khwarezmian land. George's army awaited them in a vain attempt to stop but they were defeated. After which the Mongol army headed over the Caucasus Mountains. Subutai attacked an awaiting army composed of Lezgins, Kipchaks, Volga Bulgarians and Alans. Subutai was pushed back. He bribed the Kipchaks to leave. And once the Kipchaks left he engaged the rest of the army and massacred them. He kept going and ambushed the Kipchaks. After reclaiming the loot Subutai raided Astrakhan. It was after this that Subutai and Jebe separated and went on different paths. Subutai headed down to Crimea and Jebe went to the Dnieper River. Subutai succeeded in allying with a Venetian trading post in which he would eliminate all non-Venetian colonies in return for information. Meanwhile, Tolui attacked the cities of Meru, Nishapur and Balkh. Herat was shown mercy as it surrendered immediately. Jalal Ad-din, Son of Shah Mohammed, recruited an army of 60,000. Qutugu took an army of 30000 to Parwan in a battle against Jalal Ad-Din. The Khwarezmian prince outnumbered him and they were defeated. During this battle, Qutugu had built straw men to scare his enemy. Instead, it backfired and resulted in him getting charged by a larger army. After Jalal Ad-Din lost a bit of his army due to conflicts, he headed down in an attempt to escape. Genghis Khan brought his army to the Indus river and engaged in battle before the prince had a chance to cross. When the prince launched a counterattack and started crippling the Mongol army. Genghis Khan sent reinforcements to flank the army. The enemy started losing. The Khwarezmian prince ran away from the battle. When Genghis Khan sent his commanders to chase him they failed. Meanwhile, in Europe, the surviving Kipchaks went to inform the Rus princes. The Rus principalities united with the Kipchaks with a total army of 60,000. Jebe and Subutai also united and they sent ambassadors telling them to betray the Kipchaks as they were not part of the fight. The ambassadors were killed. When the Rus princes caught up to the Mongols Subutai sent 1000 men to hold off the principalities while he escaped across the Dnieper River. Subutai feigned retreat for 9 days. After that, the Kipchaks were ahead of the princes and Subutai turned and charged at them with his heavy cavalry. His mounted archers picked off the armies of the Russian princes' armies. Mstislav of Kiev ordered a retreat and rallied all of the princes' armies. They built a makeshift fortress with baggage trains. Subutai's archers then surrounded the makeshift fortress and fired arrows at it for three days. He then offered a surrender where they could leave and ambushed them the moment they left. They were surrounded and the Mongols made a small gap. The soldiers who left were picked off by archers to prevent fatalities. The Russian princes were tied up and left under a platform where the Mongol generals ate. The princes were crushed. Subutai and Jebe then headed back to Mongolia. Raiding and pillaging more. Once back in Mongolia Subutai and Genghis Khan attacked Xi Xia for not helping the Mongols enough. On their way, Genghis's Horse threw him and he hurt his shoulder. At the age of 66, Genghis Khan died. According to Mongol tradition, the youngest son would get the domain. Genghis Khan instead split the empire. Tolui got Mongolia, Ogedei got China, Chagatai got central Asia and Juchi got Europe and Persia. The new Khan of Mongolia would be Ogedei.
